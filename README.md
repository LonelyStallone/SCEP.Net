# SCEP.Net

## A Modern .NET Fork of MicroMDM SCEP

**SCEP.Net** is a robust server implementation of the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), built on the modern .NET platform. Originating as a fork of the popular MicroMDM SCEP service, this project is engineered from the ground up to provide a seamless and secure certificate enrollment experience for modern device management.

### Core Purpose

At its heart, SCEP.Net solves a critical challenge in device management: automated and secure certificate provisioning. It acts as a dedicated certificate authority, enabling you to:

*   **Enroll Devices Effortlessly:** Automate the process of issuing client certificates to a wide range of devices—from mobile phones and laptops to IoT equipment—using the standardized SCEP protocol.
*   **Streamline Certificate Lifecycle:** Manage the entire certificate issuance process through a simple, API-driven interface, seamlessly integrating with your existing MDM (Mobile Device Management) or enterprise PKI infrastructure.

### Key Features

*   **.NET Powerhouse:** Leverages the performance, scalability, and cross-platform capabilities of the .NET runtime.
*   **SCEP Protocol Compliance:** Fully implements the SCEP protocol for reliable interoperability with a vast array of clients.
*   **Seamless MDM Integration:** The perfect backend companion for MDM solutions like MicroMDM, enabling zero-touch device enrollment and configuration.
*   **Designed for Automation:** Provides clean APIs for integration into automated workflows and modern DevOps practices.
